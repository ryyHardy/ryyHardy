Hello there! I’m @ryyHardy. I was just cooking a pizza and I realized something. My coding journey is like a pizza!
As for the things I am putting in this pizza:
1. The sauce. I am a great listener and I love working with others. When I get passionate about something, I lock in and I don't let go.
2. The bread. The fundamental ingredient of the pizza. I have strong foundations in problem-solving, algorithms, data structures and more.
3. The cheese. The ingredient you put everything on top of. For me, my base has always been Python, C++, and JavaScript. Since most languages stem from those 3, I can put a lot of things on that pizza!
4. The toppings. I absorb extra knowledge all the time! I try to have an awareness of as many languages/frameworks as possible, even if I
don't use them often. I strive to be a complete pizza.
