# What's good! I'm Ryan :dna:
I'm a rising 4th year student at Michigan State University and an aspring full-stack web developer. I am a detail-oriented thinker who is very emotionally attached to my work, which can be both a blessing and a curse (as shown by all the unfinished projects ðŸ˜…). Still, I just enjoy the process of implementing my ideas, wherever it goes. I am a hungry learner and I stay busy putting new things in my brain (may have worded that weirdly).

## Highlights :dart:
- [**Text-to-Minecraft**](https://github.com/ryyHardy/text-to-minecraft): A Minecraft bot that uses AI to build large structures in-game based on user prompts.
- [**DevDucks**](https://github.com/ryyHardy/dev-ducks): A VSCode extension concept (and [hackathon project](https://devpost.com/software/social-ducky?ref_content=my-projects-tab&ref_feature=my_projects)) which displays a chat panel in the active window, like a Twitch stream, populated with imaginary chatters that comment on your code as you type.
  - I was responsible for the FastAPI, AI-powered backend.
- [**Frontend Mentor Challenges**](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/ryyHardy): My favorite platform to practice frontend skills. It is closer to actual frontend develpment because users have to implement code to match provided designs and specifications. My submissions are all in repositories and they can also be found on the website itself.
