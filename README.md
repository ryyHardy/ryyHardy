# What's good! I'm Ryan :dna:
I'm an aspiring frontend engineer and 4th-year Michigan State student with an advanced eye for UI/UX. 
- You will usually find me obsessing over small quality-of-life details that improve apps in the little ways. Every interaction counts!
- I am a detail-oriented thinker who is very emotionally attached to my projects, which may or may not come back to bite me.
- I have a great feel for software design principles (...and don't worry. I've learned the hard way to not overengineer everything before the MVP).
- If (when) those principles break down, I will revel in the jank if need be. We all get our hands dirty at some point!

  - I was responsible for the FastAPI backend and the AI chat it provides.
- [**Frontend Mentor Challenges**](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/ryyHardy): My favorite platform to practice frontend skills in a realistic way. The repositories for my solutions have `fm-` in front of their names.
