# What's good! I'm Ryan :dna:
I'm a 4th year student at Michigan State University and an aspring full-stack web developer. I am a detail-oriented thinker who is very emotionally attached to my projects, sometimes to a fault. I enjoy the process of seeing my ideas through, and I am hungry to learn everything I can along the way.

## Highlights :dart:
- [**Pok√©Viewer**](https://github.com/ryyHardy/poke-viewer): The zen-like Pok√©mon encylcopedia! Find key information on any Pok√©mon you want, presented in a clean and concise way. Give it a try at [pokeviewer.vercel.app](https://pokeviewer.vercel.app/).
- [**Text-to-Minecraft**](https://github.com/ryyHardy/text-to-minecraft): A Minecraft bot that uses AI to build large structures in seconds based on user prompts.
- [**DevDucks**](https://github.com/ryyHardy/dev-ducks): A VSCode extension concept (and [hackathon project](https://devpost.com/software/social-ducky?ref_content=my-projects-tab&ref_feature=my_projects)) which displays a chat panel in the active window, like a Twitch stream, populated with imaginary chatters that comment on your code as you type.
  - I was responsible for the FastAPI backend and the AI chat it provides.
- [**Frontend Mentor Challenges**](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/ryyHardy): My favorite platform to practice frontend skills. It is closer to actual frontend develpment because users have to implement code to match provided designs and specifications. My submissions are all in repositories and they can also be found on the site itself.
